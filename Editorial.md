># Maximum Tourists  
The task is to find a sub-array having maximum sum with atmost 'k' odd numbers. To solve the question, we will make two-pointers pointing to the start and end of the required subarray.  
 The number of odd elements in the range of the pointers will at max be k.   
We will keep updating the max sum and the indices in every iteration of the loop.
